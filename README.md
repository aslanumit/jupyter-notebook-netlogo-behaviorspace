This is a demonstration of how to run NetLogo BehaviorSpace experiments within Jupyter Notebooks and how to publish them on platforms such as Google Colab.

This approach may be useful for a couple of cases:

* You are planning to publish supplemental materials for a publication.
* You are working on a new model and you would like to generate some preliminary data for exploratory analysis.

The notebook itself has further explanations and a demo project. You can simply open it by clicking the "Open in Colab" or "launch binder" badges above.
